/*
<Step/>

When wrapped by a <ProgressBar/>, this component renders a step of the progression.

The two main props here are accomplished and position.

🏆 accomplished :

Accomplished defines if the step has been achieved.
A step is achieved when the progression percentage is over its position.
Accomplished takes only two value : true or false.

📍 position :

Position represents, wait for it... the position of the step.
It can be defined by how much the step is far from the left of the progress bar.
Where 0 = at the extreme left and 100 = at the extreme right.
Position only accepts values between 0 and 100.
